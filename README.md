# API Documentation

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend deployed at [üö´name service here](üö´add URL here) <br>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

To get the server running locally:

üö´ adjust these scripts to match your project

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm server** to start the local server
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment

### Backend framework goes here

Accessibility and clarity comes with route specifications, therefore it's easier to have the server route to the following:

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ POST Endpoints:

The following are required fields in order to successfully POST to specified urls:

### Dreams:
////a



#### Notes:

`dreampic` requires additional logic and research (cloudinary) to be able to add images to the database.

`${server}/api/dreams`


    {
      id: INTEGER (PK++),
      dream_name: VARCHAR 128,
      dream_short_description: TEXT,
      dream_long_description: TEXT,
      donations_received: INTEGER 128,
      user_id: INT (FK),
      dreampic: VARCHAR
    }

### Users:

`${server}/api/user`

    {
      id: INTEGER (PK++),
      username: VARCHAR 128,
      password: VARCHAR 128,
      email: VARCHAR 128
    }

`${server}/api/user-info`

### User Info:

    {
      id: INTEGER (PK++)
      first_name: VARCHAR 128,
      last_name: VARCHAR 128,
      bio: TEXT,
      city: VARCHAR 128,
      state: VARCHAR 128,
      profile_pic: VARCHAR,
      user_id: INTEGER (FK)
    }

## GET Endpoints

The following outputs will differ from the post schema previously stated:

### Users:

`${server}/api/user`

#### Notes:

The list of user objects will output added properties `userInfo` and `dreams`. Both are connected through the associated tables (by joins, foreign keys, and promise logic).



    {
      id: INTEGER (PK++),
      username: VARCHAR 128,
      password: VARCHAR 128,
      email: VARCHAR 128,
      userInfo: {
                  id: INTEGER (PK++)
                  first_name: VARCHAR 128,
                  last_name: VARCHAR 128,
                  bio: TEXT,
                  city: VARCHAR 128,
                  state: VARCHAR 128,
                  profile_pic: VARCHAR,
                  user_id: INTEGER (FK)
                },
      dreams: [
                {
                  id: INTEGER (PK++),
                  dream_name: VARCHAR 128,
                  dream_short_description: TEXT,
                  dream_long_description: TEXT,
                  donations_received: INTEGER 128,
                  user_id: INT (FK),
                  dreampic: VARCHAR
                }
              ]
    }

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

### Notes:

There will be different logic for both types of get requests (for a single user and for all users) due to adding the `dreams` and `userInfo` properties.

### Dreams:

#### getDreams()

- Returns all dreams

#### getDream(id)

- Returns a single dream by ID

#### addDream(dream)

- Adds the request into the database

#### updateDreams(id, changes)

- Update a dream by ID

#### deleteDreams(id)

- Delete a dream by ID



### Users:

#### getUsers()

- Returns all users with added table properties of `dreams` and `userInfo`.

#### getUser(id)

- Returns the user with linked `dreams` and `userInfo` properties.

#### getUserDreams(id)

- Returns the list of associated dreams with user-specific id. 
 * This will just be a filtered array of dreams only pertaining to the specified user.
 * The route would be `/:id/dreams`

#### addUser(userObject)

- Creates a new user and returns that user. 

#### updateUser(id, changes)

- Updates a single user by ID.
- Changes to the password must include hash logic, similar to login logic.

#### deleteUser(id)

- deletes specified user object on CASCADE.


## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

üö´ These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app
    
    *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
    *  stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
