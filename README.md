### Payment Routes:

#### Notes: 

The route to start the transaction is through **`/stripe/charge`**. Susequently, the app posts to both:

- :one: The **`userpayment`** table to track each user's transaction.
- :two: The **`dream-payment`** table to track each dream's transaction.

Therefore, overall, you send a post request to **`/stripe/charge`** which will then post to userpayment and dream-payment.


| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control      | Description                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/stripe/charge`        | All Users           | Initial route that starts the payment transactions.|
| GET    | `/userpayment/:id`      | All Users           | Returns a specified user's payment transaction.    |
| POST   | `/userpayment`          | All Users           | Posts a new user payment.                          |
| GET    | `/dreampayment/:id`     | All Users           | Returns a specified dream's payment transaction.   |
| POST   | `/dreampayment`         | All Users           | Posts a new dream payment transaction.             |


### Images route:

#### **`/api/images`**

#### Notes:

- :one: A post request to `/api/images` actually sends a request to the third party api cloudinary. We pass in the image and the `dream_id`.
- :two: Cloudinary uploads and saves the image and returns an object that has the url of the image, which we select as `result.url`.
- :three: We insert `result.url` inside the column of `img_url`, and the id of the dream inside `dream_id`, into the table **mympyImages**.

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control      | Description                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/`                     | All Users           | Posts a new image into the database.               |


### Email route:

#### **`/mail`**

#### Notes:

- :one: A post request to `/mail` passes in the `user_id` and `dream_id.`
- :two: The route takes the ids and grabs the user's email and puts it in the sender/receiver field of the email.
- :three: The receiver (owner of the dream) gets this email in their inbox:

        'Another Mympy User Wants to Connect With You'

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control      | Description                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/`                     | All Users           | Sends an email to the dream's owner saying they want to contact them.               |


## :four: Schemas & Server GET Responses:

**SCHEMA** Refers to what you need to post in order for the server to store it. 

**RESPONSE** Refer to what the server responds with after a get request.

### Dreams:

#### Schema:

    {
        id: INTEGER (PK++),
        dream_name: VARCHAR 128,
        dream_short_description: TEXT,
        dream_long_description: TEXT,
        donation_goal: INT,
        donations_received: INTEGER 128,
        user_id: INT (FK)
    }

#### Response (for all dreams):

    {
        "id": INTEGER (PK++),
        "dream_name": "STRING",
        "dream_short_description": "TEXT",
        "donation_goal": INTEGER,
        "donations_received": INTEGER,
        "username": "STRING",
        "img_url": "http://res.cloudinary.com/mympy-cloud/image/upload/v1566320523/k6ahvssosavbcxkfkqbx.png"
    }

#### Response (For an individual dream):

**Note: \n is sent by the frontend to indicate line breaks. This is automatically inserted by the forms when users press enter.**

    {
        "id": 12,
        "dream_name": "Project Ozone",
        "dream_short_description": "A VR project that simulates the destruction of our planet in the wake of our current events.",
        "dream_long_description": "Our Ozone layer is depleting at an alarming rate. Our Amazon forests are burning, destroying the complex ecosystems that rely on the forests, and in turn, causing the extinction of species that are already endangered.\n\nBut what does this all mean for the human race? We can state all these facts, but how does this all affect us?\n\nThe Amazon Forests produces at least 20% of the world's oxygen supply by converting carbon dioxide into oxygen. The Ozone layer maintains it's structure through the use of oxygen, but is depleted by gases like carbon dioxide. The ozone layer shields at least 90% of the UV rays from the sun. Ultra violet rays causes mutation in cells, which causes cancer and the destruction of all lifeforms, including humans.\n\nCurrently, society does not place a huge importance on the effects of human pollution, deforestation, and industrialization, mostly because they are ignorant on the effects it has on us and our future generations. \n\nProject Ozone aims to inform people on the effects of the recent events that affected our planet, and to emphasize how the Ozone affects all lifeforms. \n\nWe aim to create vivid, life-life imagery that not only illuminate people on the consequences of our actions, but to spur calls of actions, so that we can take steps to change our world.\n\nJoin us in the fight to save our world--help us save our planet, and in turn, the generations to come.",

    }

### Cloudinary

Company Website: https://www.cloudinary.com/	

Cloudinary is a service that allows users to store and retrieve images for use on websites. Our application uses a back-end implementation of cloudinary whereby the image is uploaded to cloudinary and the subsequent URL that is served up by the service is stored in a database along with the project id with which it is associated. On the front-end, the URL for the image is retrieved from the database and used as background image for each project using string interpolation. 

`/api/images` is the endpoint that accesses the 'mympyImages' table which returns data in the following shape:

    {
      "id": INTEGER(PK++),
      "img_url": "STRING",
      "dream_id": INTEGER(FK)
    }

### Users:

## :five: About Auth0

-Helps to implement authentication with multiple identity providers, including social (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc), or enterprise (e.g., Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, SAML, etc.)

-log in users with username/password databases, passwordless, or multi-factor authentication
link multiple user accounts together

Helps to generate signed JSON Web Tokens to authorize your API calls and flow the user identity securely

Helps to access demographics and analytics detailing how, when, and where users are logging in
enrich user profiles from other data sources using customizable JavaScript rules

### Auth0 Authentication and Authorization form Client side

Create an Auth0Client instance before rendering or initializing your application. You should only have one instance of the client.

    //with async/await
    const auth0 = await createAuth0Client({
      domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
      client_id: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
      redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>'
    });

    //with promises
    createAuth0Client({
      domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
      client_id: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
      redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>'
    }).then(auth0 => {
      //...
    });


### 1 - Login
    <button id="login">Click to Login</button>
    //with async/await

    //redirect to the Universal Login Page
    document.getElementById('login').addEventListener('click', async () => {
      await auth0.loginWithRedirect();
    });

    //in your callback route (<MY_CALLBACK_URL>)
    window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
      const redirectResult = await auth0.handleRedirectCallback();
      //logged in. you can get the user profile like this:
      const user = await auth0.getUser();
      console.log(user);
    });



### 2 - Calling an API
    <button id="call-api">Call an API</button>
    //with async/await
    document.getElementById('call-api').addEventListener('click', async () => {
      const accessToken = await auth0.getTokenSilently();
      const result = await fetch('https://myapi.com', {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
        }
      });
      const data = await result.json();
      console.log(data);
    });

    //with promises
    document.getElementById('call-api').addEventListener('click', () => {
      auth0
        .getTokenSilently()
        .then(accessToken =>
          fetch('https://myapi.com', {
            method: 'GET',
            headers: {
              Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
            }
          })
        )
        .then(result => result.json())
        .then(data => {
          console.log(data);
        });
    });


## 3 - Logout
    <button id="logout">Logout</button>
    import createAuth0Client from '@auth0/auth0-spa-js';

    document.getElementById('logout').addEventListener('click', () => {
      auth0.logout();
    });
