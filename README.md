#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend deployed at [https://mympy-dreamers-staging.herokuapp.com/]

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

To get the server running locally:

üö´ adjust these scripts to match your project

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm run test** to start server using testing environment




### Backend framework goes here

Accessibility and clarity comes with route specifications, therefore it's easier to have the server route to the following:

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ POST Endpoints:

The following are required fields in order to successfully POST to specified urls:

### Dreams:

`/api/dreams`

#### Notes:

`dreampic` requires additional logic and research (cloudinary) to be able to add images to the database.

    {
      id: INTEGER (PK++),
      dream_name: VARCHAR 128,
      dream_short_description: TEXT,
      dream_long_description: TEXT,
      donations_received: INTEGER 128,
      user_id: INT (FK),
      dreampic: VARCHAR
    }

### Cloudinary

Company Website: https://www.cloudinary.com/	

Cloudinary is a service that allows users to store and retrieve images for use on websites. Our application uses a back-end implementation of cloudinary whereby the image is uploaded to cloudinary and the subsequent URL that is served up by the service is stored in a database along with the project id with which it is associated. On the front-end, the URL for the image is retrieved from the database and used as background image for each project using string interpolation. 

`/api/images` is the endpoint that accesses the 'mympyImages' table which returns data in the following shape:

  {
    "id": Primary key,
    "img_url": string,
    "dream_id": foreign key referencing dreams.id
  }

### Users:

#### Notes:

Login and Signup is taken care by 0auth. Profile picture uploads are taken care of by cloudinary. Email messaging system is taken care of by sendgrid.

`/api/users`

    {
      id: INTEGER (PK++),
      username: VARCHAR 128,
      password: VARCHAR 128,
      email: VARCHAR 128
    }

`/api/user-info`

### User Info:

    {
      id: INTEGER (PK++)
      first_name: VARCHAR 128,
      last_name: VARCHAR 128,
      bio: TEXT,
      city: VARCHAR 128,
      state: VARCHAR 128,
      profile_pic: VARCHAR,
      user_id: INTEGER (FK)
    }

### ADDITIONS:

## Payment Routes:

#### Notes: 

The route to start the transaction is through **`/stripe/charge`**. Susequently, the app posts to both:

- :one: The **`userpayment`** table to track each user's transaction.
- :two: The **`dream-payment`** table to track each dream's transaction.

Therefore, overall, you send a post request to **`/stripe/charge`** which will then post to userpayment and dream-payment.


| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control      | Description                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/stripe/charge`        | All Users           | Initial route that starts the payment transactions.|
| GET    | `/userpayment/:id`      | All Users           | Returns a specified user's payment transaction.    |
| POST   | `/userpayment`          | All Users           | Posts a new user payment.                          |
| GET    | `/dreampayment/:id`     | All Users           | Returns a specified dream's payment transaction.   |
| POST   | `/userpayment`          | All Users           | Posts a new dream payment transaction.             |


## Images route:

**`/api/images`**

#### Notes:

- :one: A post request to `/api/images` actually sends a request to the third party api cloudinary. We pass in the image and the `dream_id`.
- :two: Cloudinary uploads and saves the image and returns an object that has the url of the image, which we select as `result.url`.
- :three: We insert `result.url` inside the column of `img_url`, and the id of the dream inside `dream_id`, into the table **mympyImages**.

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control      | Description                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/`                     | All Users           | Posts a new image into the database.               |


## Email route:

**`/mail`**

#### Notes:

- :one: A post request to `/mail` passes in the `user_id` and `dream_id.`
- :two: The route takes the ids and grabs the user's email and puts it in the sender/receiver field of the email.
- :three: The receiver (owner of the dream) gets this email in their inbox:

        'Another Mympy User Wants to Connect With You'

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control      | Description                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/`                     | All Users           | Sends an email to the dream's owner saying they want to contact them.               |



### Auth0 Authentication and Authorization form Client side

Create an Auth0Client instance before rendering or initializing your application. You should only have one instance of the client.

//with async/await
const auth0 = await createAuth0Client({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  client_id: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>'
});

//with promises
createAuth0Client({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  client_id: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>'
}).then(auth0 => {
  //...
});


## 1 - Login
<button id="login">Click to Login</button>
//with async/await

//redirect to the Universal Login Page
document.getElementById('login').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  await auth0.loginWithRedirect();
});

//in your callback route (<MY_CALLBACK_URL>)
window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
  const redirectResult = await auth0.handleRedirectCallback();
  //logged in. you can get the user profile like this:
  const user = await auth0.getUser();
  console.log(user);
});



## 2 - Calling an API
<button id="call-api">Call an API</button>
//with async/await
document.getElementById('call-api').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const accessToken = await auth0.getTokenSilently();
  const result = await fetch('https://myapi.com', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
  });
  const data = await result.json();
  console.log(data);
});

//with promises
document.getElementById('call-api').addEventListener('click', () => {
  auth0
    .getTokenSilently()
    .then(accessToken =>
      fetch('https://myapi.com', {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
        }
      })
    )
    .then(result => result.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data);
    });
});


## 3 - Logout
<button id="logout">Logout</button>
import createAuth0Client from '@auth0/auth0-spa-js';

document.getElementById('logout').addEventListener('click', () => {
  auth0.logout();
});


## About Auth0

-Helps to implement authentication with multiple identity providers, including social (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc), or enterprise (e.g., Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, SAML, etc.)

-log in users with username/password databases, passwordless, or multi-factor authentication
link multiple user accounts together

Helps to generate signed JSON Web Tokens to authorize your API calls and flow the user identity securely

Helps to access demographics and analytics detailing how, when, and where users are logging in
enrich user profiles from other data sources using customizable JavaScript rules

## User Info Routes:

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control      | Description                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/`                     | restricted          | Returns all user profiles.                         |
| GET    | `/:id          `        | restricted          | Returns info for a single user.                    |
| POST   | `/`                     | restricted          | Post a new user profile.                           |
| PUT    | `/:id`                  | restricted          | Edit a user's profile.                             |
| DELETE | `/:id`                  | restricted          | Delete a user's profile.                           |



## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

### Notes:

There will be different logic for both types of get requests (for a single user and for all users) due to adding the `dreams` and `userInfo` properties.

## Dreams:

#### getDreams()

- Returns all dreams

#### getDreamById(id)

- Returns dreams pertaining to an ID.

#### addDream(dream)

- Adds the request into the database

#### updateDreams(id, changes)

- Update a dream by ID

#### deleteDreams(id)

- Delete a dream by ID



## Users:

#### getUsers()

- Returns all users with added table properties of `dreams` and `userInfo`.

#### getUser(id)

- Returns the user with linked `dreams` and `userInfo` properties.

#### getUserDreams(id)

- Returns the list of associated dreams with user-specific id. 
 * This will just be a filtered array of dreams only pertaining to the specified user.
 * The route would be `/:id/dreams`

#### addUser(userObject)

- Creates a new user and returns that user. 

#### updateUser(id, changes)

- Updates a single user by ID.
- Changes to the password must include hash logic, similar to login logic.

#### deleteUser(id)

- deletes specified user object on CASCADE.

## User Infos:

#### getUserInfos()

- Get all user profiles.

#### getUserInfo(id)

- Get the profile of a single user.

#### addUserInfo(id)

- Adds a new profile.

#### editUserInfo(id)

- Edits user profile

#### deleteUserInfo(id)

- Deletes the user's profile.




## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:
    
    PORT=5000//whatever port
    HOST=localhost
    DB_DEV=mympy
    DB_TEST=mympy_test
    USER=<YOUR POSTGRES PGADMIN USERNAME> default postgres
    PASS=<YOUR POSTGRES PGADMIN PASSWORD>
    BE_URL=http://localhost:5000
    FE_URL=http://localhost:3000
